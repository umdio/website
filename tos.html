        <h1 class="title">Terms of Use</h1>
        <pre>
          By using the site and the API, you automatically agree to these Terms of Use.

          umd.io is built by students for students - we aren’t the school, and we aren’t a corporation. We try to provide the best
          tool that we can, and we know that he better service we provide, the more students will rely on it, and the better
          everyone’s experience will be.

          That being said, we can’t guarantee that the API will always work the way it is documented, the way it should, or even
          work at all! We’re offering the service to be helpful, and we are licensed so that you can use it for any kind of
          project - a small one for yourself or for class, or a for-profit business. Still, we make no warranties or guarantees of
          any kind, and you, by using the site and service, fully indemnify and hold harmless umd.io and everyone associated with
          it. You also agree to limit our liability as much as the law permits.

          We don’t currently have any rate limits, but we might at some point, at will at that time update these terms. We reserve
          the right to limit your use or even shut you out entirely. We would likely only do this to protect the service, such as
          if you made so many calls to the API that it couldn’t handle it.

          We don’t collect any personally identifiable information, but the IP address of whatever application is calling the API
          will probably end up in log files. We don’t share these with anyone, and they would be tough for someone to steal, but
          again, we don’t guarantee anything.

          We’re based in Prince George’s County, Maryland, and if it came to it, you agree that any legal dispute would be settled
          in those courts.

          These terms went into effect on 5/5/2015, when they were written. If they are updated, we’ll post the notice here, and
          the changes will go into effect 15 days after they are posted here.
